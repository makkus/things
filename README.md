Things
======

# Overview

Things is a hybrid key-value-store/proxy/task-something.

Meant to make it easy to manage a set of objects *(things)* that can have dependencies between each other
(although preferably those dependencies don't get too complex). Those objects can either be stored
directly in *things*, or they can be dynamically retrieved from configurable connectors.
This setup makes is designed to make the whole, well ...thing... comparatively flexible.
